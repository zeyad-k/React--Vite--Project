# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template offers a streamlined setup for developing React applications with Vite, featuring Hot Module Replacement (HMR) for instant feedback during development and a pre-configured ESLint setup for code quality.

## Key Features

- **Fast Development Cycle:** Utilizes Vite for an ultra-fast development experience, significantly reducing the time it takes to refresh changes.
- **Type Safety:** TypeScript integration ensures type safety across the application, helping to catch errors early in the development process.
- **Hot Module Replacement (HMR):** Changes in the codebase are immediately reflected in the browser without needing a full reload, preserving application state.
- **Pre-configured ESLint:** Comes with ESLint pre-configured to enforce code quality and consistency, with the flexibility to expand rules as needed.

## Technologies

- **[React](https://reactjs.org/):** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces with components.
- **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/):** A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript, enhancing development experience with types.
- **[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/):** A modern frontend build tool that provides a faster and leaner development experience.
- **[Babel](https://babeljs.io/):** Used by `@vitejs/plugin-react` for transforming JSX into JavaScript, enabling Fast Refresh.
- **[SWC](https://swc.rs/):** An alternative to Babel used by `@vitejs/plugin-react-swc` for faster builds and Fast Refresh.
- **[ESLint](https://eslint.org/):** A static code analysis tool for identifying problematic patterns in JavaScript code.

## Expanding the ESLint Configuration

For production applications, enhancing the ESLint configuration ensures adherence to best practices and type safety. The setup includes:

- **Parser Options:** Configured to understand modern JavaScript and TypeScript, ensuring linting understands the codebase correctly.
- **TypeScript Rules:** Enhanced rules for TypeScript to enforce type checking and stylistic preferences.
- **React Plugin:** Recommended rules for React to enforce best practices and optimize for the JSX runtime.
